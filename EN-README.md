At 17, I collaborated with [Paul Mazeau](https://www.paulmazeau.com/) to develop **Pigly**, an app that in just 37 seconds, finds a restaurant, bar, or club based on your current mood, location, and preferences. This app was designed to resolve the age-old question: "Where should we eat?" However, this project is now **deprecated**.

## The Project
Pigly was conceived to simplify the process of finding a place that matches your current desires and mood. The application was designed to provide quick and relevant solutions for local dining options, thus eliminating the indecision often associated with choosing a place to eat.

## User Experience Design
The initial phase involved extensive user research, where we identified common issues people face when looking for a restaurant that matches their mood. We conducted surveys and interviews with frequent diners and performed a competitive analysis of existing apps.

### Developed Personas
1. **Sasha, the Student**:
   - Age: 15-25
   - Very comfortable with technology, frequently uses a smartphone for various tasks.
   - Goal: To quickly find restaurants that match specific cravings, budget, and location preferences.

2. **Thomas, the Young Professional**:
   - Age: 25-30
   - Comfortable with technology, primarily uses a smartphone for utility tasks.
   - Goal: To quickly locate a restaurant that meets dietary requirements, location preferences, and time constraints.

We transformed our user research into detailed personas and user stories, which guided the user flows within the app. These flows describe the path a user would follow to achieve their goals with Pigly.

#### Mockups and Prototypes
I created low-fidelity wireframes that laid out the basic structure and functionalities of the app, which we refined based on user feedback. This iterative design process was crucial for developing a user-centered design.

## Technical Development
After finalizing the design, I began the development phase. The tech stack was chosen based on my prior experience with MyColoc: React Native with Expo and Firebase, ideal for quickly deploying a scalable app suitable for both Android and Apple platforms.

## Conclusion
Throughout the development of Pigly, we maintained detailed documentation of our research findings, personas, user journeys, mockups, prototypes, and user feedback. This documentation is invaluable and will continue to guide us throughout the appâ€™s lifecycle.

Although this project is no longer active, Pigly was user-centric and solved a real problem for its users by providing a quick and convenient way to find a restaurant that matches their mood and preferences.
